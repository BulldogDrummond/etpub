
Important Notes For Upgrading etpub 0.9.x to 1.0.x
--------------------------------------------------

1) Because Even Balance no longer supports Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and ETpub's Shrubbot and
   XPSave system depends on PunkBuster's guid, we decided to make both systems possible without a
   running PunkBuster server. All you have to do is to install the latest (> 20100628) ETpub
   client on your server.
   
   The client guid is fully compatible to PunkBuster and will be generated by an existing etkey
   file. If the etkey file does not exist it will be automatically downloaded from etkey.org. No
   stored XP or shrubbot permissions will be lost.

2) With this version the g_mode server cvar was completely removed. To unlock weapons for certain
   classes use g_unlockWeapons instead. All other options of g_mode have been moved to g_misc.
