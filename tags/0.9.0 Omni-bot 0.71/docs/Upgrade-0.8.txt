
Important Notes For Upgrading etpub 0.7.x to 0.8.x
--------------------------------------------------

1) Greetings are added to the [level] and [admin] shrubbot blocks. Though the
   server should add those field automatically, you might want to back-up your
   shrubbot.cfg first.

2) All the old killingspree and banner cvars have been changed or moved to the
   new settings.cfg file. Carefully read the docs to see how to set up this
   file.

3) The "muted" field in the xpsave file has been replaced by the "mutetime"
   field. This allows a variable mutetime. This also means all the players that
   where muted will be unmuted during the upgrade to 0.8.x.
