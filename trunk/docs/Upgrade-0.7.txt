
Important Notes For Upgrading etpub 0.6.x to 0.7.x
--------------------------------------------------

1) The behaviour of g_inactivity has changed.  It will move players to
   SPECTATOR instead of dropping them.

2) The behaviour of g_spectatorInactivity has changed.  It will only drop
   players if the server is full.

3) The shrubbot flag '1' no longer gives protection from server
   inactivity settings.  You must give the '0' flag to the admin/level
   if you don't want it to be effected by inactivity settings.
