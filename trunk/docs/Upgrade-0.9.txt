
Important Notes For Upgrading etpub 0.8.x to 0.9.x
--------------------------------------------------

1) If you have decided to use the etpub distribution with Lua API support
   you'll need the Lua shared library file located in the Enemy Territory
   installation directory. Please read step three of docs/Install.txt for
   details on how to obtain and install the file.

2) To use the new country flags feature you'll need the GeoIP.dat database
   file inside the server's etpub directory.
   
   2.1) Download the compressed GeoIP database file GeoIP.dat.gz from
        http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCountry/.

   2.2) Decompress it and copy it into the server's etpub directory.
