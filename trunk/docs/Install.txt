
etpub Installation
------------------

etpub is a server side only modification.  This means that it only is 
installed on servers and clients do not need to download any files to
play on etpub servers. 

Using the etpub client is however highly recommended and brings many new
features like the country flags, custom huds or team and class menus.

To install etpub on your server, you only need to ensure that the 
Enemy Territory binary loads the qagame shared library instead of the
default one when it is started.  Below I'll describe how to
install etpub for each of the supported platforms.

Configuration and detailed setup instructions are not covered in this
document.  See the directory docs/Example of the etpub distribution
for example configuration files and visit http://etpub.org/ for more
detailed instructions.

Linux
-----

1) Create a directory named 'etpub' next to the 'etmain' directory in either
the enemy-territory installation directory or the ~/.etwolf/ directory
of the user that runs etded.x86.  By default the game installation directory
is located at /usr/local/games/enemy-territory/

2) Copy the glibc-2.1/qagame.mp.i386.so file from the etpub distribution
to the 'etpub' directory created in step one.

3) To use the country flags feature, you'll need the GeoIP database file located
in the directory from step one. Please read the README in extra/GeoIP for details
on how to obtain the file.

4) Ensure that etded is called with the command line arguments 
' +set fs_game etpub ' (in addition to the ones you already use).

Windows
-------

1) Run setup.exe in the win32 directory.

2) To use the country flags feature, you'll need the GeoIP database file located
in the directory from step one. Please read the README in extra/GeoIP for details
on how to obtain the file.

For manual install instructions, see http://etpub.org/content.php?content.4


Mac
---

Sorry, mac support has been dropped for the server version of etpub.  There
doesn't appear to be a way to load a custom qagame without packing it into a 
pk3.
