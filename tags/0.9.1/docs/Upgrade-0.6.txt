
Important Notes For Upgrading etpub 0.5.x to 0.6.x
--------------------------------------------------

1) the cvar g_activeTeamBalance has been renamed to g_ATB_diff.  You must
   also set g_ATB to 1 in order to get the 0.5.x behaviour.  If you had

	set g_activeTeamBalance 50
   
   and want to keep the same settings, you must change it to:

	set g_ATB 1
	set g_ATB_diff 50

2) If you want the behaviour from 0.5.x that prevented players from sticking
   their heads into solids, you must enable the g_misc 32 flag.

3) If you use etpub_client, you should update it to at least version 20051103.

4) XPSave now saves to a file.  The name of this file is set with the
   g_XPSaveFile cvar and is relative to the fs_game directory.  If you use
   g_XPSave, ensure that the user that runs your server process has permission
   to write to your fs_game directory so that this file can be created.

5) A new vote option (shufflenorestart) has been added and is allowed by
   default.  If you don't want this vote to be allowed you must do:
	set vote_allow_shufflenorestart 0

6) If you've previously used the g_killrating 4 flag to have players sorted
   by killrating when shuffling, you'll need to set the new cvar
   g_shuffle_rating to 3 instead.
